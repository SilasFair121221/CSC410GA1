# CSC410GA1
The repo for GA assignment

This genetic algorithm assignment takes lists of genomes and crosses them over using a simple genetic algorithm



Assignent 1: 
Refresh your memory of creating and manipulating dynamically allocated data structures 
Continue connecting ideas for genetic algorithms and a possible underlying implementation. 
Increase the sophistication of your GA program (NEW)
Continue working with the command line in Linux 


Assignment 2:
Refresh your memory of C++ classes (continuation from CSC236)
Refresh your memory of creating and manipulating dynamically allocated data structures (continuation from CSC236)
Refresh your memory of how to use Git repositories
Start connecting ideas for genetic algorithms and a possible underlying implementation. (NEW)
Introduce working with the command line in Linux (NEW)
Introduce Makefiles as a way to build C++ programs. (NEW)



Assignment 3: 
Continue connecting ideas for genetic algorithms and a possible underlying implementation. 
Implement a system for a population of genomes that works to rank genomes based on a roulette wheel (new)
Generating a new population using crossover (NEW)
